  <h2 class='padding_10px padding_top_bottom'>What happened in 2019</h2>
  <p class='padding_10px'>The 2018-19 Raptors were the first team of Raptors to ever make it to the NBA finals, and not only make it, win it. This was a very special and iconic year for Toronto and the NBA as a whole. This is the first time Toronto has won the NBA championship, and the first time a team outside of the USA has won the NBA title. It's very special that Canada finally brought home a champtionship after 72 years of the NBA being around. Basketball was invented by a Canadian after all, and 72 long years later the highest prestiege of honour when it comes to basketball has finally come home. Back to what happened in 2019, the raptors won due to many reasons, it wasn't a single element that lead to the win. There were lots of trades, and tough decesions that had to be made, we really put it all on the line to win. Masai Ujiri, the president of the raptors is the one to be thanked for this, he made all the hard decesions, and he had his mind fixated on winning the championship, and he made a lot of hard decesions in order to make that dream come true.

  <!--The most iconic shot in raptors history--->
  <div class="box_2019">

    <p class='padding_10px'>On May 12th, 2019, Kawhi Leonard hit one of the most iconic shots in Raptor history, if not the most iconic. There are so many special things about this shot. Firstly it was a game 7 buzzer beater, the only other player to have one of those is Jordan himself. Secondly he was heavily, with a 7 footer tracking his every step, and forced him to shoot the ball much higher so it wouldn't get blocked, which made it an extremely difficult shot. Ironicly this game was also against Philadelphia to who the Raptors lost a game 7 in 2001, 18 years ago. In that game Vince Carter, attemtped the game winning shot but missed; 18 years later Kawhi leonard hit that shot on the same team and the Raptor's advanced this time.</p>

       <h4>Nick Nurse</h4><p>After losing to the Cleveland for the 3rd year in a row the Raptor's organization made the extremely hard decesion to fire the head coach Dwayne Casey. He was doing extremly well during the regular season, with the Raptor's breaking all time win records. The problem was they couldn't get around this brick wall lead by Lebron James, they weren't even close. Thats why Dwyane Casey was fired and the assintant coach at the time who was Nick Nurse got a promotion. Nick Nurse was able to lead the team to a championship in his rookie coaching season which is quite the achievement. He was just better suited for coaching the Raptors and he was the first key element in the championship run. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
          <h4>Kawhi Leonard</h4><p>This was by far the main factor that lead to the championship run. Kawhi is a super-star player, and he was coming of an injury so there was a bit of risk takin him since we had to trade our star Demar DeRozan for him. This was an extremely hard choice to make, especially since all the fans love DeRozan, and he was willing to stay in Toronto for years to come and grow with the team. While Kawhi was only going to sign for one year, which would make it an all or nothing decesion. Masai Ujiri decided to go all in and it payed off. The season after winning Kawhi left and the Raptor's struggled, but this is a very common thing for championship teams. </p>
  
  </div>
  <div class="column">
      <h4>Mark Gasol</h4><p>Many people overlook Mark Gasol as a key element, but his role was very important. No he wasn't the superstar carring the team, but he was shooting some three's, getting inside scoring some points, plus on defense he is 7 feet tall and it's very nice to have someone of that size on your side. We had to trade another young player who was willing to grow with Toronto, and was also 7 feet tall, but it had to be done for the all or nothing gamble at the championship. Jonas Valanciunas was traded for Mark Gasol since Gasol had a lot more experience and could be a better leader to the team. Gasol was also a little more polished.</p>
